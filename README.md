- Syncing Plejd internal clock

## Thanks
Big thanks to [@klali](https://github.com/klali) and his https://github.com/klali/ha-plejd component for Home assistant, this project would not have been possible without it.

And another big thank to Jonas Almquist and every contributor for your donations that got me a Homey!
